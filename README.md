Image Converter is a desktop GUI application for converting images between JPEG, PNG and GIF formats

The app, still under development is written in Python using the PIL library for image manipulation and Tkinter for the GUI

The user can now:

    Select an image file for conversion using a file selection dialog - no need to type the filepath

    Choose the file type to be converted to from a dropdown menu

    Select if resizing is required and if so enter dimensions

    Choose the new file name and location from a file save dialog

Currently the app supports conversion between the following filetypes:

    JPEG

    PNG - Portable network Graphics

    GIF - Graphics Interchange Format

    BMP - Bitmap

    TIFF - Tag Image File Format

Issues / still to-do:

Possible support for producing icon (.ico) files

Aesthetic changes and improvements to the GUI
