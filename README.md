Image Converter is a desktop GUI application for converting images between JPEG, PNG and GIF formats

The app, still under development is written in Python using the PIL library for image manipulation and Tkinter for the GUI

The user can now:

    Select an image file for conversion using a file selection dialog - no need to type the filepath

    Choose the file type to be converted to from a dropdown menu

    Choose the new file name and location from a file save dialog

Currently the app supports conversion between the following filetypes:

    JPEG

    PNG

    GIF

Issues / still to-do:

Add more file types for conversion

Add resize functionality for thumbnails / web images

Aesthetic changes and improvements to the GUI

Testing
